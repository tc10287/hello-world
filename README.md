# hello-world
this is tenzin, trying to actually understand the working of GitHub
i wanted to test out and try to understand or implement commit here so i'll be writing a pthon code that I learned today

import os
filz=open('Resume-choetso.pdf','r+')
print('file name is ",filz.name)
print('file access mode is",filz.mode)
rd=filz.read(10)
print('the files can read:",rd)
filz.close()
